# Coding100 [Jumpyrinth]

## Description
While doing his mission preparation tests, R-boy notices  in the file he's reading that the data has been inserted in a  mysterious order. Read the text with him and discover what's behind it.

## Challenge
The zip provided by the challenge contains two files. The first one contains a matrix of characters, the second one contains the rules to find the flag. In another words we have to code a little parser following the rules. After a while we realized that there are more possible flags in the file. Indeed there are more than one "$" and "@" (which define the start and the end of the path)

In the file `result` you can find the output of the exploit

## Flag
{FLG:H4ckItUpH4ckItInL33tM3B3g1n}
